<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >Particle transport Monte Carlo simulations are a key tool for High Energy Physics
experiments, including the LHC experiments at CERN. All Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations depend vitally on Pseudo-Random Number Generators
(PRNGs) used to sample many distributions. PRNGs used must possess
very large periods, fast execution, the ability to create a large number of
streams, and very good correlation properties between streams and sampled
values. One of the key requirements for simulation is that it must be
possible to reproduce a simulated event any time, for reexamination or
debugging.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   In Geant the history of the passage of a particle through matter forms a track.
Each track is divided in steps defined by scatterings, geometry boundaries or user
limits. Because of the transition from event-level parallelism in Geant4 to
dynamical multithreading in GeantV, the tracks in one event or even parts of the
same track are processed by different threads. Thus to assure reproducibility the
pseudo-random engine state must be associated with the track itself; and
the state of the secondary track has to be a deterministic function of
the parent track. The sequence of the number of older siblings of each
ancestor of a track uniquely represents its pedigree. The hashed pedigree
of the track can be used to initialize the state of the random number

<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >The standalone prototype was implemented in accordance with the <a 
href="https://sd57.github.io/g4dprng/gsoc-proposal-Savin.html" >proposal</a>.
There is an implementation compatible with any HepRandomEngine from the
CLHEP library included in geant4 and a specific version for Philox and
Threefry generators from <a 
href="https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_random123.html" >Random123</a> library to reduce the abstraction
overhead. There is a unit test for each implementation that traverses
the tree in width-first and depth-first order and checks the equality of
outcome.

<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   A supplementary 64-bit state was added to G4Track. The stored number
represents the hashed pedigree of the track. The hashed pedigree is used to seed
the random number generator at the beginning of processing each track. The
hash is a <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction" >Merkle-Damgård</a>&#x00A0;construction with standard hash followed by
boost_combine used as the compression function and a random number as the
initialization vector. To toggle the random number generation behavior at
runtime a Geant4 macro command was added. For testing the p-values for
pairs of histograms obtained with different track processing order were
calculated.

<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x1-6000doc"><!--tex4ht:ref: USERTIME --></a> shows run times of a standard geant4 example with the standard
random number generation and with reseeding based on pedigrees for different
random number generators. The overhead depends on the complexity of the
seeding function of the random number generator. It is small for the new
counter-based generators, because the complexity is shifted to the output
function.
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a> Conclusion </h3>
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >We implemented a Geant4 prototype who can perform fully reproducible
simulations in a multithreaded environment and under the exchange of the order
of track propagation. We profiled the overhead to achieve this reproducability for
different random number engines and showed that it is quite low for selected
engines.
<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   Therefore it is worth to apply a similar algorithm for reproducible
pseudo-random number generation in GeantV.
